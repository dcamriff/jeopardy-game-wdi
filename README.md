# jeopardy-game-wdi

## DESCRIPTION
For my first WDI Project, I decided to create a Jeopardy Game for Kids.

## INSPIRATION
Having two young girls, I get to see the positive impact that educational games and apps have on their ability to enjoy learning. This game encourages young minds to use memory, practice typing, spelling and punctuation skills, and injects a little laughter into their learning also.

## USER STORES
Here are the user stories and a link to my [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/0b5flAN0/wdi-project-1-diane-jeopardy) where I planned out my project.
